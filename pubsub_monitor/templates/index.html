  <title>Nano-stream file upload PubSub monitoring</title>
</head>
<body>
<div>
  <p>Monitors whether PubSub is working as intended. Refreshes are needed for updates.</p>
  <p>Common problems to look out for:</p>
  <p>1. No messages: Either PubSub or GSC Object Change Notifications aren't working, or the app deploy environment has changed. </p>
  <p>   Test if you can send any messages from the message box (scroll all the way down). </p>
  <p>   Send message, click back, and refresh. </p>
  <p>       If the new message appears, check object notifications. If working, probably Google bug.</p>
  <p>       If no new messages appear, go back to cloud shell, and re-deploy the app. This sometimes happens when you git clone/pull to a newer version. </p>

  <p>2. Duplicates: Doesn't seem to be anything we can do about this, it's a bug that sometimes occurs when Google pushes new features. </p>
  <p>Messages received by this instance:</p>
  <ul>
    {% for message in messages: %}
      <li>{{message}}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
<form method="post">
  <textarea name="payload" placeholder="Enter message here"></textarea>
  <input type="submit">
</form>
</body>
